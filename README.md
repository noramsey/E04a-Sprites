# E04a-Sprites Exercise

This is an exercise to start experimenting with sprites in Python Arcade. This repository assumes that you have Python Arcade installed.

The exercise takes place across three files:

I did everything that was asked of me and am still somewhat confused. Mostly I edited lines of code to change the position of icons pulled from the Python Arcade library. Main3 was the most confusing for me, it felt like I was stumbling but then it suddenly worked- Changing Center_X = X to Center_X = Center_X seemed like cylcical logic to me but I think the other attributes of the Mouse-control function is what made that work.
